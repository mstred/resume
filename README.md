# resume

Inspired by [@thomasdavis/resume](https://github.com/thomasdavis/resume), this project's purpose is to simply store my `resume.json` file in a GitHub repository, publishing it to a Gist if it matches a valid schema from [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) spec.

After published, it should be renderable through https://registry.jsonresume.org/mstred. See details at https://jsonresume.org/getting-started.
